      <p>
        Moore’s Law has driven exponential advances in computing for over five decades by predicting that the number of components on an integrated circuit would double roughly every two years. However, as silicon transistors approach atomic-scale dimensions, physical, economic and technological barriers are slowing this trend. This article examines the key factors contributing to the decline of Moore’s Law, including the end of Dennard scaling, increased transistor variability and the high cost of advanced lithography. It then explores emerging technologies that could sustain future performance growth, such as two-dimensional semiconductor materials, specialised computer architectures and improvements in algorithms and data movement efficiency. Although no single technology can fully replace classical scaling, the combined progress in materials science, device engineering and heterogeneous architectures offers promising pathways. These developments suggest that while Moore’s Law may be reaching its limits, innovation in computing is far from slowing down.

    <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div id="introduction-section">
      <p>
        Since the 1960s, the semiconductor industry has relied on a trend known as Moore’s Law: the observation that the number of components on an integrated circuit doubles roughly every two years. This scaling has enabled continuous improvements in computing performance, transforming consumer electronics, scientific computing and global communication. For decades, advances in silicon lithography made this progression predictable and economically viable. However, as transistors approach atomic-scale dimensions, the physical foundations supporting Moore’s Law are weakening. Quantum effects, increased fabrication costs and fundamental material limits now constrain further miniaturisation, leading experts to predict that Moore’s Law will plateau in the near future

      <p>
        This article explores the causes of this slowdown, including the physical limits of silicon, and examines emerging pathways such as two-dimensional semiconductors and specialised computing architectures that may sustain performance improvements beyond traditional transistor scaling

    <!-- ANALYSIS & DISCUSSION -->
    <h2>Analysis and Discussion</h2>
    <div id="analysis-discussion-section">

      <h3>Why Moore’s Law Is Slowing and the Limits of Silicon</h3>
      <p>
        Moore’s Law was enabled by the continual reduction in transistor size. Smaller transistors switch faster, consume less power and allow more components to be placed on a single chip. This scaling is now approaching unavoidable limits. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) predicted that lithographic scaling would effectively end around 2021, almost a decade sooner than earlier forecasts
        <a href="#ref-shalf">(Shalf, 2020)</a>. At gate lengths of only a few nanometres, a very small number of silicon atoms define the critical features of each transistor, making further miniaturisation extremely difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        The breakdown of Dennard scaling has amplified these problems. Dennard scaling assumed that power density remained constant as transistors shrank, allowing clock speeds to increase each generation. This relationship failed around 2004, leading to stagnating clock frequencies and a shift towards multi-core processors. Shalf shows that since the mid-2000s, increases in performance, clock rate and core count have all flattened, indicating that adding more transistors no longer delivers proportional performance gains
        <a href="#ref-shalf">(Shalf, 2020)</a>. At the same time, each new generation of fabrication equipment is significantly more expensive, reducing the economic benefits of further scaling and contributing to the expectation that Moore’s Law will “flatten by 2025”
        <a href="#ref-shalf">(Shalf, 2020)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Material physics also impose hard limits. As channels become extremely thin, electrons experience increased scattering from imperfections on surfaces and interfaces, reducing their mobility and slowing current flow. Even alternative bulk semiconductors, such as germanium or indium gallium arsenide, suffer from degraded performance when reduced to nanometre thicknesses
        <a href="#ref-li">(Li et al., 2019)</a>. In addition, quantum mechanical effects such as tunnelling and leakage currents become more pronounced, increasing power consumption and device variability. These issues show that the slowdown of Moore’s Law is driven by both economic and physical constraints.
      </p>

      <h3>Two-Dimensional Materials as a Potential Successor</h3>
      <p>
        One promising response to these limitations is the exploration of two-dimensional semiconductors – crystalline materials only one atom thick. Examples include molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and tungsten diselenide (WSe<sub>2</sub>). Because these materials have atomically flat surfaces and fewer dangling bonds, electrons experience less scattering, allowing for potentially faster and more efficient transistors
        <a href="#ref-li">(Li et al., 2019)</a>. Their extreme thinness enables channels that are much thinner than those achievable with bulk silicon, offering a route to continued device scaling beyond current limits.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Li et al. emphasise that several major research challenges must be overcome before two-dimensional materials can be used in commercial devices
        <a href="#ref-li">(Li et al., 2019)</a>. Predicting their electronic properties accurately is difficult because real samples deviate from ideal models. Growing large, uniform and low-defect films is technically demanding, with many samples showing grain boundaries and thickness variations. Performance comparisons between devices are further complicated by inconsistent fabrication and measurement techniques. As a result, two-dimensional materials are best viewed as a long-term candidate for extending Moore’s Law rather than an immediate replacement for silicon technology.
      </p>

      <h3>Architectural and Algorithmic Solutions Beyond Moore’s Law</h3>
      <p>
        Even if transistor scaling slows dramatically, computing performance can still improve through innovations above the device level. Leiserson et al. argue that future gains will increasingly come from advances in algorithms, software and system architecture rather than from transistor miniaturisation alone
        <a href="#ref-leiserson">(Leiserson et al., 2020)</a>. Modern systems already employ heterogeneous architectures, combining CPUs, GPUs and specialised accelerators such as Google’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These designs use transistors more efficiently by tailoring hardware to specific computational tasks, rather than relying on a single general-purpose processor for all workloads
        <a href="#ref-shalf">(Shalf, 2020)</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another critical insight is that data movement now consumes more energy than computation itself. Shalf shows that moving data even a few millimetres across a chip can require more energy than performing a 64-bit arithmetic operation
        <a href="#ref-shalf">(Shalf, 2020)</a>. This implies that future architectures must prioritise data locality, employ advanced packaging techniques such as three-dimensional integration and, in some cases, use photonic interconnects to reduce the energy cost of communication. In this post-Moore environment, performance improvements depend increasingly on how efficiently data and computation are organised, and on the co-design of hardware and algorithms.

    <!-- CONCLUSION -->
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <div id="conclusion-section">
      <p>
        Moore’s Law has been central to the evolution of modern computing, enabling steady improvements in performance, efficiency and affordability. The physical limits of silicon, the breakdown of Dennard scaling and the rising cost of fabrication now show that traditional transistor miniaturisation cannot continue indefinitely. Nevertheless, the end of Moore’s Law does not imply the end of progress. Two-dimensional semiconductors offer a possible route to further scaling, although significant scientific and manufacturing challenges must be addressed before they can be adopted widely
        <a href="#ref-li">(Li et al., 2019)</a>. At the same time, architectural specialisation, heterogeneous accelerators and algorithmic optimisation provide practical strategies for improving performance without relying solely on smaller transistors
        <a href="#ref-leiserson">(Leiserson et al., 2020)</a>. Together, these developments suggest that the future of computing will be shaped by a combination of materials innovation, system-level design and software advancements rather than by transistor scaling alone.
